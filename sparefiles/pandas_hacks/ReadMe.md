### Overview

These notebooks are from a presentation with Statistical Seminars DC
Here is the original event link: https://www.meetup.com/statistical-seminars-dc/events/287061482/

The purpose was to prview helpful hacks that you can't live without in Pandas. We designed this presentation for beginners to learn more + also for intermediate and advanced to see a refresher or two on helpful shortcuts.

### The Notebooks

`Pandas_Cant_Live_Transpose.ipynb` - This notebook shows how you can use the `.transpose()` mothod following the `.describe()` method to improve the layout of output in your notebook.

`Pandas_Cant_Live_Missing_Heat.ipynb` - This notbook demonstrates using Seaborn's heatmap in combination with Pandas `.isnull()` method to quickly scan a dataset for missing values.

`Pandas_Cant_Live_Saving_Data.ipynb` - This notebook reminds folks that it is important to be careful when saving data. Defaulting to the usual .csv can have detrimental effects later (e.g. ambigous data types). Using multiple formats may assist in future proofing your projects. Also, this notbook looks closely at the `.to_html()` method which works well to make for a swift data inspector and also well as a way to share data for others to inspect.

`Pandas_Cant_Live_Pandas_Profile.ipynb` - This notebook shows how to use the popular Pandas Profiling package.

`Pandas_Cant_Live_Pandas_Profile-Titanic.ipynb` - This notbook also shows how to use the popular Pandas Profiling package but with the very popular Titanic data. This notebook also compares the Pandas Profiling output with the popular pairplot (and a few other EDA) techniques.

Enjoy!
